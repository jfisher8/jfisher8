### Thanks for stopping by! üëã

I'm a First-Class Honours University graduate working full-time in the Cyber Security industry and working on side projects as I go. My current area of interest programming-wise is Android development, working with the Flutter SDK and Dart language to build mobile apps for various purposes. I also have experience developing for the web, with PHP, HTML, & CSS being my main forte specifically. However, I have recently begun delving into the world of NextJS for web development.

Outside of my technical life, I'm a massive football fan and I'm a season ticket holder for my local team, which ironically usually costs me more of my sanity than debugging errors does...

- üë®‚Äçüç≥ Currently working on The Diamond Hands Crypto Tracker - A mobile app for Android surrounding cryptocurrency price tracking and news. Intended to one day be open-source and available on the Google Play Store.
- ‚úçÔ∏è Refreshing myself on Flutter & Dart's best practices whilst also learning NextJS for web development here and there, too.
